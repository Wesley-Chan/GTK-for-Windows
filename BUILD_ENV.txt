---------------Instructions for setting up a building environment--------------

This file shows you how to set up a building environment with MinGW-w64,
MSYS and the other tools. Make sure you read README.txt before reading this.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Go to /z_Install.

2. Run 0_DOWNLOAD_ALL.bat to download all the tools needed automatically. If
you're sure that you got some of them exactly, you can put them into those
folders correspondingly. The download script will have them skipped.

3. Make sure there's no directories named "MinGW" or "msys" in your C:\,
because we're going to use them. If you formally installed them, please
consider renaming them.

4. Run INSTALL_ALL.bat and follow the instructions (usually just pressing any
key). It will setup everything for you. Mind the messages show up! If anything
goes wrong, it might be an unfinished download package or permission denied.

5. When the prompt (finally) dismisses, you're ready to go.

Alternatively, you can run the batch files listed in INSTALL_ALL.bat one by
one manually.
